    1. The DOM Ready Event
    The first step to manipulating the DOM is subscribing to the DOM Ready event. This is not only a matter of
    convention â€“ the event is fired only when all page elements are present and accessible, so your jQuery selectors
    actually return anything. But do you know that there is a neat way to subscribe to the ready event that works
    consistently cross-browser and doesn't even depend on jQuery? Here is how to do it:

    <pre>
        // with jQuery
        $(document).ready(function(){ /* ... */ });
        // shorter jQuery version
        $(function(){ /* ... */ });
        // without jQuery (doesn't work in older IEs)
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
        // your code goes here
        }, false);
        // and here's the trick (works everywhere):
        r(function(){
        alert('DOM Ready!');
        });
        function r(f){/in/.test(document.readyState)?setTimeout('r('+f+')',9):f()}
    </pre>

    The trick here, as explained by the o riginal author, is that we are checking the document.readyState property.
    If it contains the string in (as in Loading) we set a timeout and check again. Otherwise we execute the passed
    function.
